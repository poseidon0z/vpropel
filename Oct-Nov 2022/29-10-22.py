"""To Divide Or Not
Alice likes all the numbers which are divisible by A. Bob does not like the numbers which are divisible by B and likes all the remaining numbers.

Determine the smallest number greater than or equal to N which is liked by both Alice and Bob.

Output -1 if no such number exists.

Input Format

The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers A, B, and N â€” the parameters mentioned in the problem statement.

Output Format

Output the smallest number >= N which is divisible by A and is not divisible by B.

Output -1 if no such number exists."""
